This project includes code for a robot that perform “pick and place” actions around a specified playfield. The robot needs to move around obstacles to reach a Flag Zone, where multiple flags would be present. The robot needs to identify a Green Flag, and pick it up. Afterwards, it must traverse its way through the course and drop off the flag at a specified Goal Zone. The robot operates in three modes, which are Level 1: Remote Control, Level 2: Confirmation Mode, and Level 3: Scout Mode. 

Includes:
	Arduino Code: Ultra Sonic Sensors, Servo Motors, Pi Bi-direction Serial Comm

	Python Code:
		Marvel Mind: Code to initialize and obtain data from Marvel Mind Hedge
		Motor Control: Code to control a holonomic robot using 4 motors
